          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>The Urban Suburban Affordables (USA) program, created by the <a href="https://cljct.org/what-we-do/housing-initiatives/">Center for Leadership and Justice (CLJ)</a> , aims to increase affordable housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income families in the Greater Hartford region, including both urban areas like Hartford and surrounding suburban communities. The USA facilitates homeownership through innovative approaches such as <a href="https://groundedsolutions.org/strengthening-neighborhoods/community-land-trusts/">Community Land Trusts (CLTs)</a>, which work by purchasing land and selling the homes built on it to low-income residents, while the CLJ  retains ownership of the land itself. This separation of land ownership and homeownership is significant because it reduces the upfront cost of buying a house, making it more accessible to families, while maintaining affordability even as surrounding land values rise, and ensuring that housing remains affordable through restrictions on resale prices. Making housing more affordable for low- and moderate-income residents, preventing land prices from increasing rapidly. Therefore CLTs offer a promising solution to the Greater Hartford region’s housing challenges by keeping housing affordable for future generations. This is because CLTs implement a resale formula that sets an “allowable sales price” when a resident decides to sell. This formula allows the homeowner to recoup up to 50 percent of any appreciation in the home's value during their ownership, as well as 100 percent of any improvements made to the property, plus closing costs. In this way, residents are able to build personal wealth, while the property continues to serve the community’s long-term housing needs, fostering both individual financial stability and broader community resilience. This initiative has helped over 200 families purchase their first home in the Greater Hartford area. The CLJ has an estimated portfolio of around $53 million.</p>
          <p>We researched the location of the USA homes in each census tract, focusing on homes located in five municipalities (Bloomfield, East/West Hartford, Hartford, and Windsor), to answer the question: Where are USA homes located in the area, and in what types of neighborhoods? Specifically, we examined median household income and eviction data. This research is crucial because it provides valuable insights into the neighborhoods where USA homes are located, shedding light on the economic and housing dynamics of these areas. Understanding the correlation between the locations of USA homes, eviction rates, and median household income helps to identify which neighborhoods are most in need of affordable housing opportunities. Areas with higher eviction rates may signal communities under greater housing stress, while neighborhoods with lower median incomes could indicate populations that would most benefit from homeownership programs. These areas indicate a lack of housing stability, which is frequently driven by rising rent costs, limited affordable housing options, and sometimes discriminatory practices. In neighborhoods with low median incomes, residents face additional challenges in accessing stable housing, as the cost of rent consumes a large portion of their earnings, leaving little room for savings or wealth-building. For example high down payments and insufficient credit, preventing families from accumulating equity and perpetuating cycles of poverty. In such areas, homeownership programs can provide a critical solution by enabling families to build wealth through equity, ensuring long-term housing stability, and reducing eviction risks. Programs like Community Land Trusts (CLTs) and down payment assistance make homeownership more accessible.</p>
          <p>For the Center for Leadership and Justice (CLJ), this information is vital in identifying strategic locations for acquiring more underlying land for affordable housing development. It allows the CLJ to target regions where affordable homeownership could have the most significant impact, particularly in areas facing economic challenges or housing instability. By using eviction and income data, the USA program can expand its reach to the neighborhoods that need it most, offering low- to moderate-income families a pathway to homeownership, financial stability, and long-term community resilience. Ultimately, this approach not only supports individual families but also contributes to the broader goal of strengthening the community by providing equitable access to affordable housing.</p>

          <h2>Median Household Income</h2>

          <p>We are focusing on where USA homes are located compared to median household incomes in their areas to show the disparities of wealth spread around the greater Hartford area. It is evident that the downtown Hartford area has the least amount of median household income, as you stray away into neighboring areas the wealth grows. What is surreal is that some of the surrounding West Hartford census tracts have more than 10 times the amount of household income than in Hartford, just neighborhoods away.</p>

          <p>ADD USA HOMES HISTOGRAM</p>
          <img src="screenshots/Histogram of Median Income.png" style="width:100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>As seen, most of the USA homes are in medium income areas. We defined these income ranks by separating the median household incomes of the census tracts into three eqaul parts. These separations are at $45,000 and $85,200 to define the high/medium/low income areas.</p>
          
          <p>Below is a map of the median household income in the towns: East Hartford, Hartford, West Hartford, Bloomfield, and Windsor</p>

          <h2>Evictions</h2>

        <p>This map matters because it shows the total numbers of evictions filled in each census tract within the Greater Hartford region, offering valuable insight into the housing instability in neighborhoods near USA houses. By highlighting eviction patterns in surrounding areas, the map serves as a crucial tool for understanding the broader housing challenges faced by these communities. These high eviction rates in specific areas are a clear indicator of housing insecurity and patterns of consistently high evictions. Which reflects deeper systemic issues such as poverty, unemployment, or a lack of affordable housing. Therefore, mapping this data can highlight these disparities and show which neighborhoods have high eviction rates and how through CLTs, the CLJ is able to facilitate homeownership in the Greater Hartford region. </p>

          <h2>Methods & Sources</h2>

         <p>The median household income data was found through the American Community Survey's 5-year estimate of median household incomes in census tracts throughout all of Connecticut. From there the data was cleaned to only the 5 municipalities that we are focusing on. There are two census tracts without any data, tract 5245.02 had no household income reported in the survey. Tract 9801 had a population of 938, but no income or housing data are listed because 100% reside in the Hartford Correctional Center.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
